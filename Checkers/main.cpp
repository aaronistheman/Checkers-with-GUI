	My method of detecting capture is described below and dependent on vector addresses.

	See either function void prepareGame() or void defaultBoard(vector<sq::Square> &sqVect) for the coding of these vector addresses.

	How capture is detected:
	There are eight kinds of relationships that indicate a capture (four for red, four for black).
	The directional words (right/left) describe the direction of the movement of the selected piece.

		Red:
			1) start odd-numbered row, going right:
				3         sq
						 /
				2      sq
					  /
				1  sq
					a  b  c
				-In the above example, the piece on a1 is jumping to c3, capturing the piece on b2.
				-The vector address of a1 is 0, of b2 is 4, and of c3 is 9.
				-Notice that from a1, the initial square, to b2, the captured square, the jump in address is 4 (0 to 4).
				-Notice that from b2 to c3, the landing square, the jump in address is 5 (4 to 9).
				-The jump in addresses remain the same in any red piece's jump from a square on an odd-numbered row 
				 (to another odd-numbered row), so long as the direction of capture is right (as opposed to left).
				-For example:
				7         sq
						 /
				6      sq
					  /
				5  sq
					e  f  g
				-The vector address of e5 is 18, of f6 is 22, and of g7 is 27.
				-Notice that from e5 to f6, the jump in address is 4 (18 to 22).
				-Notice that from f6 to g7, the jump in address is 5 (22 to 27).
			
			2) start even-numbered row, going right:
				6         sq
						 /
				5      sq
					  /
				4  sq
					d  e  f
				-In the above example, the piece on d4 is jumping to f6, capturing the piece on e5.
				-The vector address of d4 is 13, of e5 is 18, and of f6 is 22.
				-Notice that from d4, the initial square, to e5, the captured square, the jump in address is 5 (13 to 18).
				-Notice that from e5 to f6, the landing square, the jump in address is 4 (18 to 22).
				-The jump in addresses remain the same in any red piece's jump from a square on an even-numbered row 
				 (to another even-numbered row), so long as the direction of capture is right (as opposed to left).
			
			3) start odd-numbered row, going left:
				5  sq
					  \
				4      sq
					     \
				3         sq
					c  d  e
				-In the above example, the piece on e3 is jumping to c5, capturing the piece on d4.
				-The vector address of e3 is 10, of d4 is 13, and of c5 is 17.
				-Notice that from e3, the initial square, to d4, the captured square, the jump in address is 3 (10 to 13).
				-Notice that from d4 to c5, the landing square, the jump in address is 4 (13 to 17).
				-The jump in addresses remain the same in any red piece's jump from a square on an odd-numbered row 
				 (to another odd-numbered row), so long as the direction of capture is left.
				
			4) start even-numbered row, going left
				4  sq
					  \
				3      sq
					     \
				2         sq
					f  g  h
				-In the above example, the piece on h2 is jumping to f4, capturing the piece on g3.
				-The vector address of h2 is 7, of g3 is 11, and of f4 is 14.
				-Notice that from h2, the initial square, to g3, the captured square, the jump in address is 4 (7 to 11).
				-Notice that from g3 to f4, the landing square, the jump in address is 3 (11 to 14).
				-The jump in addresses remain the same in any red piece's jump from a square on an even-numbered row
				 (to another even-numbered row), so long as the direction of movement is left.

		Black:
			1) start odd-numbered row, going left (from our view):
				3         sq
						 /
				2      sq
					  /
				1  sq
					a  b  c
				-In the above example, the piece on c3 is jumping to a1, capturing the piece on b2.
				-The vector address of c3 is 9, of b2 is 4, and of a1 is 0.
				-Notice that from c3, the initial square, to b2, the captured square, the drop in address is 5 (9 to 4).
				-Notice that from b2 to a1, the landing square, the drop in address is 4 (4 to 0).

			2) start even-numbered row, going left:
				6         sq
						 /
				5      sq
					  /
				4  sq
					d  e  f
				-In the above example, the piece on f6 is jumping to d4, capturing the piece on e5.
				-The vector address of f6 is 22, of e5 is 18, and of d4 is 13.
				-Notice that from f6, the initial square, to e5, the captured square, the drop in address is 4 (22 to 18).
				-Notice that from e5 to d4, the landing square, the drop in address is 5 (18 to 13).

			3) start odd-numbered row, going right:
				5  sq
					  \
				4      sq
					     \
				3         sq
					c  d  e
				-The vector address of c5 is 17, of d4 is 13, and of e3 is 10.
				-From c5 to d4, the drop in address is 4 (17 to 13).
				-From d4 to e3, the drop in address is 3 (13 to 10).

			4) start even-numbered row, going right:
				4  sq
					  \
				3      sq
					     \
				2         sq
					f  g  h
				-The vector address of f4 is 14, of g3 is 11, and of h2 is 7.
				-From f4 to g3, the drop in address is 3 (14 to 11).
				-From g3 to h2, the drop in address is 4 (11 to 7).

		How do I use the above information to detect a capture?
		-First, determine the turn (either red or black).
		-Second, determine the oddness or evenness of the row of the initial square.
		-Third, determine the direction of movement (done by comparing the columns of the initial and landing squares).
		
		-After collecting all this information, there is one possible capture pattern which may or may not be met.
		-For example, if the turn is red, the row is even, and the direction is left, then the program checks if
		 red's 4th capture condition is satisfied. See function bool isCapture() for the codification.

		Why did I select this method of detecting capture?
		-My other option was to use many messy, bunched-up if-statements.
		-For example, on black's 4th capture condition's example, I would have pseudo-coded:
			//if selected square is f4
				//if target square is h2 and empty
					//if middle square is g3 and occupied by red
						//do capture
		**I would have 32 of these for each of the 32 accessible squares.
		**8 different capture conditions means 32*8=256 sets of the above if-statements.

		-With the method I chose, for black's 4th capture condition's example, I instead pseudo-code:
			//if the difference between the vector addresses of the selected and middle squares is 3
				//if the difference between the vector addresses of the middle and targeted squares is 4
					//if middle square is occupied by red
						//do capture
		**I would have only 1 of these to handle all 32 squares.
		**8 different capture conditions means 1*8=8 sets of the above if-statements.
