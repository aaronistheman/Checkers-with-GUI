# Checkers-with-GUI


About
-----

This is a Checkers application that I programmed during the summer (2013) after my sophomore year in high school, before I knew anything of object-oriented programming. Thus, the code, divided among many files, consists of many functions, and may not be particularly well-written.

I programmed this in C++ with the help of the SFML 2.0 library. I used Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Express.

Please see the following video for a demonstration: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUPKaMpN1WA.


Features
--------

This application supports the general rules of checkers, including crowned pieces and double captures.


Directions
----------

To open the project, open Checkers.sln with Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Express. Run the project to try it. (Note that the SFML files are included in the repository.)


Releases
--------

The most recent release is: v0.1

The latest code can be found under the releases section of this Git repository.
