# Checkers-with-GUI


About
-----

This is a Checkers application that I programmed during the summer (2013) after my sophomore year in high school, before I knew anything of object-oriented programming. Thus, the code, divided among many files, consists of many functions, and may not be particularly well-written.

I programmed this in C++ with the help of the SFML 2.0 library. I used Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Express.


Features
--------

This application supports the general rules of checkers, including crowned pieces and double captures.
